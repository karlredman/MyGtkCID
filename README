This is the begginings of the modem programming for a personal portal system I was developing.
THIS IS OLD CODE. I'm providing this code for example purposes only. The last time I checked 
the console version of the program was broken.

Note that this program was developed using a Zoom 2949L external modem.

Sincerely,
