MyCID: README file


This is a simple console and gtk+ GUI test program for reporting Caller ID information.  Note that this program was developed using a Zoom 2948L external modem.  The modem command is set to respond to AT+VCD=1 but you can change that if you wish. I built this program for testing and learning purposes -hope it helps.

REQUIREMENTS:
gtk+ development package: for the project to build	version 1.2.10
glibc							version 1.2.10
Zoom 2949L External comatible modem (uses AT+VCID=1 for Caller ID)

TO BUILD THE PROJECT:
1. '. ./my_automake` (my own script for automake options)
2. 'make'
3. run the programs under the src/ directory

Sincerely, 
Karl N. Redman
